Action - describes the changes in the sate
Reducer - actually carries out the state changes given by action
Store - holds the state of the application

Middleware ******
Redux middleware provides a third-party extension point between dispatching an action, and the moment it reaches the reducer. 
People use Redux middleware for logging, crash reporting, talking to an asynchronous API, routing, and more.

Middleware allows for side effects to be run without blocking state updates. 
We can run side effects (like API requests) in response to a specific action,

Redux Thunk middleware allows you to write action creators that return a function instead of an action. 
The thunk can be used to delay the dispatch of an action, or to dispatch only if a certain condition is met. 
Used to make api calls

Redux Thunk is a middleware that lets you call action creators that return a function instead of an action object. 
That function receives the store’s dispatch method, which is then used to dispatch regular synchronous actions inside the function’s body 
once the asynchronous operations have been completed.

Once Redux Thunk has been installed and included in your project with applyMiddleware(thunk), you can start dispatching actions asynchronously.


Redux Thunk is a middleware that allows you to call the action creators that return a function(thunk) 
which takes the store's dispatch method as the argument and which is afterwards used to dispatch the synchronous action after the API 
or side effects has been finished.
