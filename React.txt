React


General **********
State is similar to props, but it is private and fully controlled by the component.
Another difference is that you cannot return false to prevent default behavior in React. You must call preventDefault explicitly.
Hooks are a new addition to React in version 16.8 that allows you use state and other React features, like lifecycle methods, without writing a class
https://blog.bitsrc.io/why-we-switched-to-react-hooks-48798c42c7f
What is a Hook? A Hook is a special function that lets you “hook into” React features. 
For example, useState is a Hook that lets you add React state to function components.

a bit of installation  process *********


What is React *****
React is  front end, JavaScript library for building user interfaces or UI components. It is maintained by Facebook 

One of the main ways it does that is by encouraging you to be declarative instead of imperative. 
You get to declare how your components should behave and look under different states, and React’s internal machinery handles the complexity 
of managing updates, updating the UI to reflect changes, and so on.

Reconciliation *****
Reconciliation is the process through which React updates the DOM. When a component's state changes, 
React has to calculate if it is necessary to update the DOM. It does this by creating a virtual DOM and comparing it with the current DOM. 
In this context, the virtual DOM will contain the new state of the component.

React commands *****
create-react-app myfirstreact



How does React work? ***********
React creates a virtual DOM. When state changes in a component it firstly runs a "diffing" algorithm, which identifies
what has changed in the virtual DOM. And only updates those changes in real DOM

Document Object Model

Features of React *********
JSX
Reusable Component
Virtual DOM
Performance
One-way Data Flow
Extensions
Debugging



JSX ******
JSX is a syntax extension to JavaScript. It is used with React to describe what the user interface should look like. 
By using JSX, we can write HTML structures in the same file that contains JavaScript code. 
This makes the code easier to understand and debug, as it avoids the usage of complex JavaScript DOM structures.
const name = 'Simplilearn';

const greet = <h1>Hello, {name}</h1>;

The above code shows how JSX is implemented in React. It is neither a string nor HTML. Instead, it embeds HTML into JavaScript code



Virtual DOM ********
React keeps a lightweight representation of the “real” DOM in the memory, and that is known as the “virtual” DOM (VDOM).
When the state of an object changes, VDOM changes only that object in the real DOM instead of updating all of the objects. 
The virtual DOM (VDOM) is an in-memory representation of Real DOM. The representation of a UI is kept in memory and synced with the “real” DOM. 
It’s a step that happens between the render function being called and the displaying of elements on the screen. 
This entire process is called reconciliation.

Component ***********
Encapsulated units of functionality that are the primary unit in React. They utilize data (properties and state) to render your UI as output;
The rendering process (outputting and updating a UI based on your data) is predictable in React, and your components can hook into it using React’s APIs.

Performance ********
React uses VDOM, which makes the web applications run much faster than those developed with alternate front-end frameworks. 
React breaks a complex user interface into individual components, allowing multiple users to work on each component simultaneously, 
thereby speeding up the development time. 



One-way Data Flow ********
React’s one-way data binding keeps everything modular and fast. A unidirectional data flow means that when a developer designs a React app, 
they often nest child components within parent components. This way, a developer knows where and when an error occurs, 
giving them better control of the whole web application.



Extensions ********
React goes beyond simple UI design and has many extensions that offer complete application architecture support. 
It provides server-side rendering, which entails rendering a normally client-side only web application on the server, 
and then sends a fully rendered page to the client. It also employs Flux and Redux extensively in web application development. 
Finally, there is React Native, a popular framework derived from React, used to create cross-compatible mobile applications.



Debugging ********
React applications are easy to test due to a large developer community. Facebook even provides a small browser extension that makes 
React debugging faster and easier.




Why we use react *********
Easy creation of dynamic applications: React makes it easier to create dynamic web applications because it requires less coding and 
offers more functionality, as opposed to JavaScript, where coding often gets complex very quickly.

Improved performance: React uses Virtual DOM, thereby creating web applications faster. 
Virtual DOM compares the components’ previous states and updates only the items in the Real DOM that were changed, 
instead of updating all of the components again, as conventional web applications do. 

Reusable components: Components are the building blocks of any React application, and a single app usually consists of multiple components. 
These components have their logic and controls, and they can be reused throughout the application, 
which in turn dramatically reduces the application’s development time.

Unidirectional data flow: React follows a unidirectional data flow. This means that when designing a React app, developers often nest child components 
within parent components. Since the data flows in a single direction, it becomes easier to debug errors and 
know where a problem occurs in an application at the moment in question.

Small learning curve: React is easy to learn, as it mostly combines basic HTML and JavaScript concepts with some beneficial additions. 
Still, as is the case with other tools and frameworks, you have to spend some time to get a proper understanding of React’s library.

It can be used for the development of both web and mobile apps: We already know that React is used for the development of web applications, 
but that’s not all it can do. There is a framework called React Native, derived from React itself, that is hugely popular and is used for creating 
beautiful mobile applications. So, in reality, React can be used for making both web and mobile applications.

Dedicated tools for easy debugging: Facebook has released a Chrome extension that can be used to debug React applications. 
This makes the process of debugging React web applications faster and easier.


Types of Components ***********

Functional Components also know as stateless , dumb, presentational
Class Components also know as stateful, smart, container


Functional Components *************
These components have no state of their own and only contain a render method, so they are also called stateless components. 
They may derive data from other components as props (properties).
function Greeting(props) {
  return <h1>Welcome to {props.name}</h1>;
}


Class Components ***********
These components can hold and manage their state and have a separate render method for returning JSX on the screen. 
They are also called stateful components, as they can have a state.





React Fragment ****
Helps us to get rid of the extra div





Props ***********
Props are short for properties. It is a React built-in object which stores the value of a tag’s attributes and works similar to the HTML attributes. 
It provides a way to pass data from one component to other components in the same way as arguments are passed in a function.
As opposed to state in React, props are read-only. So, the data coming from a parent component can't be changed by the child component.

State vs. Props ******

State	

Use Case	State is used to store the data of the components that have to be rendered to the view	
Mutability	State holds the data and can change over time	
Component	State can only be used in class components	
Updation	Event handlers generally update state	

Props

Use Case	Props are used to pass data and event handlers to the children components
Mutability	Props are immutable—once set, props can't be changed
Component	Props can be used in both functional and class components
Updation	The parent component sets props for the children components



Prop Drilling *********
Prop drilling is basically a situation when the same data is being sent at almost every level due to requirements in the final level. 




Bundling ********
Most React apps will have their files “bundled” using tools like Webpack, Rollup or Browserify. 
Bundling is the process of following imported files and merging them into a single file: a “bundle”. 
This bundle can then be included on a webpage to load an entire app at once.


Basic rules of Hooks ******
Only Call Hooks at the Top Level
Don’t call Hooks inside loops, conditions, or nested functions. 
Only Call Hooks from React Functions







Different React Hooks **********
React hooks, is used to manage state in functional components,
Basic Hooks-
useState
useEffect
useHistory
useLocation
useMemo
useParams

Additional Hooks-
useContext
useReducer
useCallback
useRouteMatch

https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-reference.html

useState *********
To maintain state at local level.
const [state,setState]=useState();


UseEffect ******
It is a replacement for componentDidMount,componentDidUpdate,componentWillUnmount
its used for Conditionally run effects pass second parameter in useEffect for which only useEffect should re-render
It returns clean function
used to fetch API data
useEffect(()=>{},[])


What does useEffect do? **********
By using this Hook, you tell React that your component needs to do something after render. 
React will remember the function you passed (we’ll refer to it as our “effect”), and call it later after performing the DOM updates. 
In this effect, we set the document title, but we could also perform data fetching or call some other imperative API.

Why is useEffect called inside a component? ***** 
Placing useEffect inside the component lets us access the count state variable (or any props) right from the effect. 
We don’t need a special API to read it — it’s already in the function scope. 
Hooks embrace JavaScript closures and avoid introducing React-specific APIs where JavaScript already provides a solution.

Does useEffect run after every render? *********
Yes! By default, it runs both after the first render and after every update. 
Instead of thinking in terms of “mounting” and “updating”, you might find it easier to think that effects happen “after render”. 
React guarantees the DOM has been updated by the time it runs the effects.


useContext ************
introduced to eliminate nesting complexcity while consuming process	
1.Create Context.... export const ThemeContext = React.createContext();..it creates context obj
2.It gives Provider and consumer
3. Provider syntax... <ThemeContext.Provider value={some value to pass for child component}>
4. Consume them ... const theme=useContext(ThemeContext)
const themes = {
  light: {
    foreground: "#000000",
    background: "#eeeeee"
  },
  dark: {
    foreground: "#ffffff",
    background: "#222222"
  }
};

const ThemeContext = React.createContext(themes.light);

function App() {
  return (
    <ThemeContext.Provider value={themes.dark}>
      <Toolbar />
    </ThemeContext.Provider>
  );
}

function Toolbar(props) {
  return (
    <div>
      <ThemedButton />
    </div>
  );
}

function ThemedButton() {
  const theme = useContext(ThemeContext);
  return (
    <button style={{ background: theme.background, color: theme.foreground }}>
      I am styled by theme context!
    </button>
  );
}




useHistory *******
History also has location but it is mutable
Similar to window.history
const history=useHistory()


useLocation *******
Similar to window.location


useMemo ****
Cache result of the function called

function returnValue(inputValue) {
      return inputValue + 10;
    }

    var calculatedValue = useMemo(() => returnValue(10), [10]);
	
In other words, useCallback gives you referential equality between renders for functions. 
And useMemo gives you referential equality between renders for values.
	

function foo() {
  return 'bar';
}

const memoizedCallback = useCallback(foo, []);
const memoizedResult = useMemo(foo, []);

memoizedCallback;
// ƒ foo() {
//   return 'bar';
// }
memoizedResult; // 'bar'
memoizedCallback(); // 'bar'
memoizedResult(); // 🔴 TypeError

So what is the difference? useCallback returns its function uncalled so you can call it later, 
while useMemo calls its function and returns the result.


useParams *********
To pass parameter from url used in router
<Route path="/payment/:outletId/:customerId/:tableno/:price" component={CheckoutBot} />

import { useParams } from 'react-router';
const { outletId, customerId, tableno, price } = useParams();


useRef ****
useRef gives us a mutable object whose current property refers to the passed initial value. 
If we don't change it manually, the value will persist for the entire lifetime of the component.

useReducer *****
It is used for state management
const [count,dispatch]=useReducer(reducer,initialState)
reducer(currentState,action)

const initialState={first:0}
const reducer= (state,action)=>{
	switch(action.type){
		case "increment":
		return {first:state.first + action.value}
	}
	
}

<button onClick={()=>{dispatch({type:"increment", value:5})}}> Click</button>

Virtual DOM uses who's memory...clientside or server **************
clientside



Custom Hooks **********
Custom Hook is a JavaScript function whose name starts with use.
Share logic-this are an alternatve to HOC and Render Props

function useCustomHooks() {
  let userName = "Mayank";
  let userDesignation = "Trainer";
  return [userName, userDesignation];
}

function ApplicationComponent() {
  const [name, designation] = useCustomHooks();
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>User Name: {name}</h1>
      <h2>User Designation: {designation}</h2>
    </div>
   )
}

“use” appended to function name representing Custom Hooks
The Custom Hook above is returning some values
The Custom Hook can then be Re-used





Set interval syntax ****
 var myVar = setInterval(alertFunc, 3000);
 clearInterval(myVar) 
 
 
Inside package.jason different between dependances and dev-dependances **************
--save in while running command in terminal **********
The difference between these two, is that devDependencies are modules which are only required during development, 
while dependencies are modules which are also required at runtime. 
To save a dependency as a devDependency on installation we need to do an npm install --save-dev , instead of just an npm install --save.


Diff algorithm **************
The diff command is invoked from the command line, passing it the names of two files: diff original new . 
The output of the command represents the changes required to transform the original file into the new file. 
If original and new are directories, then diff will be run on each file that exists in both directories.




Use of "Key" in Component...if not provided then which error (also used in Virtual DOM) **************

A key is a unique identifier. In React, it is used to identify which items have changed, updated, or deleted from the Lists. 
It is useful when we dynamically created components or when the users alter the lists. It also helps to determine which components 
in a collection needs to be re-rendered instead of re-rendering the entire set of components every time.
Keys should be given inside the array to give the elements a stable identity. 
The best way to pick a key as a string that uniquely identifies the items in the list. It can be understood with the below example.

If key is not provided then we get a warning msg but the component is displayed




bundler (Webpack) **************
Webpack is an aggressive and powerful module bundler for JavaScript applications. ... It takes in various assets, 
such as JavaScript, CSS, Fonts, Images, and HTML, and then transforms these assets into a format that's convenient to consume through a browser.
Webpack is a tool that lets you compile JavaScript modules, also known as module bundler. Given a large number of files, 
it generates a single file (or a few files) that run your app.It can perform many operations: helps you bundle your resources.


transpiler **************
A source-to-source translator, source-to-source compiler (S2S compiler), transcompiler, or transpiler is a type of translator that 
takes the source code of a program written in a programming language as its input and produces an equivalent source code in the same 
or a different programming language.

(Babble) *******************
Babel is a toolchain that is mainly used to convert ECMAScript 2015+ code into a backwards compatible version of JavaScript 
in current and older browsers or environments
Babel is a JavaScript compiler and not a webpack loader. It compiles (transpiles) higher JavaScript code (ES6+) to lower JavaScript code (such as ES5).
Because of babble we can write html inside Js




difference between Element and Component  ********
Component is made up of elements



Why React uses className instead of class ********
class is a Reserved keyword in javascript



React Router **********
React Router, and dynamic, client-side routing, allows us to build a single-page web application with navigation without the page refreshing 
as the user navigates
React Router plays an important role to display multiple views in a single page application
history.replace prevents going back from brower button.



useRouteMatch **********


Props data prev and next store ****
https://blog.logrocket.com/how-to-get-previous-props-state-with-react-hooks/

// custom hook for getting previous value 
function usePrevious(value) {
  const ref = useRef();
  
  useEffect(() => {
    ref.current = value;
  });
  
  return ref.current;
}

// the App where the hook is used 
function Counter() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
  // 👇 look here
  const prevCount = usePrevious(count)

  return <h1>Now: {count}, before: {prevCount}</h1>;
}

// How the App is rendered 
<Counter />


Single page Routing *******
Use Link from react Router.



Link vs NavLink ******
The Link component allows navigating the different routes on the websites, whereas 
NavLink component is used to add styles to the active routes has activeClassName for css



React Router vs traditional Router ********
traditional Router uses server side rendering
React Router uses client side rendering



browser-router vs hashrouter **********
<BrowserRouter>: It is used for handling the dynamic URL.
<HashRouter>: It is used for handling the static request.
browser-router A <Router> that uses the HTML5 history API (pushState, replaceState and the popstate event) to keep your UI in sync with the URL.
hashrouter  A <Router> that uses the hash portion of the URL (i.e. window.location.hash) to keep your UI in sync with the URL.
<MemoryRouter>  A <Router> that keeps the history of your “URL” in memory (does not read or write to the address bar). 
Useful in tests and non-browser environments like React Native.



Nested Router ************
Using route inside route


Route ******
It is used to define and render component based on the specified path


How to prevent Rerendering of child component *******
Use memo to stop it
UseCallBack()
Return null from the render method.
React.memo()
A component can re-render even if its props don’t change. 
More often than not this is due to a parent component re-rendering causing the child to re-render.
To avoid this, we can wrap the child component in React.memo() to ensure it only re-renders if props have changed:

techniques for optimizing react application performance ********
useMemo Hook
useCallback Hook
Take out unnecessary source code.
Use constant and inline elements.
Lazy Loading
Use PureComponents
Invoke high order components
React.memo()

Synthetic Events ********






Material UI? *******
In a nutshell, Material-UI is an open-source project that features React components that implement Google's Material Design. 
... With over 35,000 stars on GitHub, Material-UI is one of the top user interface libraries for React out there





error boundary react *******
error boundary is a component which catch errors during rendering from child componet tree

class ErrorBoundary extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = { hasError: false };
  }

  static getDerivedStateFromError(error) {
    // Update state so the next render will show the fallback UI.
    return { hasError: true };
  }

  componentDidCatch(error, errorInfo) {
    // You can also log the error to an error reporting service
    logErrorToMyService(error, errorInfo);
  }

  render() {
    if (this.state.hasError) {
      // You can render any custom fallback UI
      return <h1>Something went wrong.</h1>;
    }

    return this.props.children; 
  }
}



Pure Component *******
A React component is considered pure if it renders the same output for the same state and props.
Pure Components in React are the components which do not re-renders when the value of state and props has been updated with the same values. 
If the value of the previous state or props and the new state or props is the same, the component is not re-rendered.


Why Pure Components? *******

Pure components have some performance improvements and render optimizations because React implements the shouldComponentUpdate() method 
for them with a shallow comparison for props and state.

Controlled Vs Uncontrolled Component ***********
Controlled- In HTML, form elements such as <input>, <textarea>, and <select> typically maintain their own state and update it based on user input. 
In React, mutable state is typically kept in the state property of components, and only updated with setState().
We can combine the two by making the React state be the “single source of truth”. 
Then the React component that renders a form also controls what happens in that form on subsequent user input. 
An input form element whose value is controlled by React in this way is called a “controlled component”.
Uncontrolled- the value attribute is absent or it's default value and can be changed
Benifite- instant validation
input type file can be controlled
A controlled component has its state completely driven by React,
Uncontrolled components can maintain their own internal state. E.g., a textarea's value.


Conditional Rendering *********
if else
Element Variable
ternary operator
Short circuit operator ( Condition && what to display)
Optional chaining--checkif conditional rendering
Nullish coalescing operator (??)


Controlled Vs Uncontrolled Data input (any performance issue?) ***********
Not sure but if it's suggested by react to use then it doesn't have performance issue


Single source of truth *******
Using useState in form input value



How to pass data from parent to child (props) ***********
using props for small chain
use context for long chain


How to pass data from child to parent ***********
Create a callback function in the parent component. This callback function will get the data from the child component.
Pass the callback function in the parent as a prop to the child component.
The child component calls the parent callback function using props.



Dependency injection ***********
What is dependency injection? Classes often require references to other classes. 
For example, a Car class might need a reference to an Engine class. 
These required classes are called dependencies, and in this example the Car class is dependent on having an instance of the Engine class to run.

How to pass data from component to component with no relationship *********
Redux



Services (API) ***********


HOC(High order Component) ***********
These functions are pure, which means they are receiving data and returning values according to that data.
Higher Order Component (HOC) is wrapping around "normal" component and provide additional data input. 
It is actually a function that takes one component and returns another component that wraps the original one
Its used to enchance the input component and is reusable
it is used to share common functionality between component without repeating code

const WithComponent=OriginalComponent=> {
    function NewComponent(props){
        const [state,setState]=useState(0)
        function Increament(){
            setState((prev)=>prev+1)
        }
        function Decreament(){
            setState((prev)=>prev-1)
        }
        return (
            <div>
                <OriginalComponent state={state} Increament={Increament} Decreament={Decreament} {...props}/>
            </div>
        )
    }
    return NewComponent
}

export default WithComponent


Can HOC(High order Component) be pure components ***********
Yes



sanitize method in coding ***********
HTML sanitization is the process of examining an HTML document and producing a new HTML document that preserves 
only whatever tags are designated “safe” and desired. 
HTML sanitization can be used to protect against cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks by sanitizing any HTML code submitted by a user.




How to add/remove css class ***********
useState


Render Props  ***********
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZil2OTyB4w&list=PLC3y8-rFHvwgg3vaYJgHGnModB54rxOk3&index=37
The term “render prop” refers to a technique for sharing code between React components using a prop whose value is a function.
The Render Props pattern involves passing a function as a prop to a component, allowing that component to render or provide data to its child components. 
The parent component provides a function as a prop, and the child component invokes that function, typically passing relevant data or state back to the parent. 
This pattern promotes reusability and flexibility by allowing components to be composed in different ways.



Stop Rendering for unchanged values inside component *************
UseMemo,
UseRef



react render vs hydrate ***********
Hydrate is basically used in case of SSR(Server side Rendering). ... hydrate() is same as render() , 
but it is used to hydrate(attach event listeners) a container whose HTML contents were rendered by ReactDOMServer. 
React will attempt to attach event listeners to the existing markup.




server side rendering(SSR) ***********
In Client-side rendering, your browser downloads a minimal HTML page. It renders the JavaScript and fills the content into it.
Server-side rendering, on the other hand, renders the React components on the server. The output is HTML content.
You can combine these two to create an isomorphic app.




package.lock.json ******
it locks the version of installed dependencies





Too many smaller components leading to over engineering 
lots of necessary packages e.g. react router


How to integrate API ***********
API ********

import axios from "axios";

 function getData(){
    const url="https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts"
    axios.get(url).then((res)=>{
        // console.log(res.data);
        setPost(res.data)
    }).catch((error)=>{
        console.log(error);
    })
}

function SubmitHandler(e){
    e.preventDefault()
    console.log(state);

    const url="https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts"
    axios.post(url,state).then((res)=>{
        console.log(res);
        
    }).catch((error)=>{
        console.log(error);
    })

}

Using Fetch

async function getData(){
	const url="https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts"
	const response= await fetch(url)
	const data = response.jason()

}

async function postData(){
	let item={name,email,description}
	const url="https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts"
	const response= await fetch(url,{
	method :"POST",
	headers:{
	"Content-Type":"application/jason"
	"Accepted":"application/jason"
	},
	body: JASON.stringify(item)
	});
	// const data = response.jason()

}

difference between put and post ******
Put is used to update the resource while post is used to create the resource.
Put request can be safely called multiple times but post can't as it will create duplicate resources
Watch this when free https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1xVK2m817Bw



PropTypes *****
Used to fix the type of props

import PropTypes from 'prop-types';
function Employee({ name, salary }) {
  return (
    <h1>{name}'s salary is {salary + 0}</h1>
  );
}
Employee.propTypes = {
  name: PropTypes.string,
  salary: PropTypes.number
}



Life Cycle Methods of react ***********
https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-understand-a-components-lifecycle-methods-in-reactjs-e1a609840630/
Mounting--
componentWillMount()
This method is called just before a component mounts on the DOM or the render method is called. After this method, the component gets mounted.
After this method, the component gets mounted.
 
componentDidMount()
This method is called after the component gets mounted on the DOM. 
Like componentWillMount, it is called once in a lifecycle. 
Before the execution of this method, the render method is called (i.e., we can access the DOM). 
We can make API calls and update the state with the API response.


Updating--
shouldComponetUpdate()
This method determines whether the component should be updated or not. By default, it returns true. 
But at some point, if you want to re-render the component on some condition, then shouldComponentUpdate method is the right place.

componentWillUpdate()
It is called before the re-rendering of the component takes place. It is called once after the ‘shouldComponentUpdate’ method. 
If you want to perform some calculation before re-rendering of the component and after updating the state and prop, 
then this is the best place to do it.

componentDidUpdate()
This method is called just after the re-rendering of the component.
After the new (updated) component gets updated on the DOM, the ‘componentDidUpdate’ method is executed.
This method receives arguments like prevProps and prevState.

Unmounting--
componentWillUnmount()
This method is called before the unmounting of the component takes place.
Before the removal of the component from the DOM, ‘componentWillUnMount’ executes. This method denotes the end of the component’s lifecycle.


Error handling--componentDidCatch



React Class Component

1.Mounting Lifecycle

Constructor(props):-
A special function that will get called whenever a new component is created.
Initializing state.
Binding the event handlers

4. UseLocalStorage

DOM ***********

The DOM provides a structured way of accessing, storing, and manipulating different parts of a document. 
At a high level, the DOM is a tree structure that reflects the hierarchy of an XML document. This tree structure is comprised of subtrees
that are in turn made of nodes. You’ll probably know these as the divs and other elements that make up your web pages and applications.
You’ve probably used the DOM API before—but you may not have known you were
using it. Whenever you use a method in JavaScript that accesses, modifies, or stores
information related to something in an HTML document, you’re almost certainly using
the DOM or its related APIs. This means that not all the methods you’ve used in JavaScript are
necessarily part of the JavaScript language itself (document.findElemenyById,
querySelectorAll, alert, and so on). They’re part of the bigger collection of web
APIs—the DOM and other APIs that go into a browser—that allow you to interact with
documents.

componentWillUnmount equivalent in hooks****
To do the cleanup after the component unmounts, we have a simple way to perform the equivalent of the componentWillUnmount using the useEffect Hook.
The only thing that we need to do is to return a function inside the callback function of the useEffect Hook, like this:

useEffect(() => {
  window.addEventListener("mousemove", () => {});
  return () => {
    window.removeEventListener("mousemove", () => {})
  }
}, []);
